# Property Rental Platform

## Challenge Overview
Develop a website using React. The website will replicate a property rental platform with
essential features, including property listings and booking management. This challenge
combines coding, UI design, logical thinking, user interaction, and critical problem-solving.

## Approach
### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Styling**: CSS Module
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Routing**: React Router Dom
- **Database (optional)**: Firebase Realtime Database

### Implementation Details
1. **Property Listings**: Display a variety of properties with essential details such as images, titles, address, prices, and booking options. Implement filters to facilitate easy sorting based on coordinate direction, price range, number of bedrooms, and parking availability.

2. **Booking Management**: Develop a booking management system where users can add properties to their cart, view property details, and manage their bookings[such as inc/dic quanity and remove from cart]. 

3. **Checkout Process**: Create a seamless checkout process that calculates the total cost of booked properties. Implement real-time updates for the cart total and booking count.

4. **Feedback Section**: Develop a feedback section to display user feedback retrieved from JSON data. 

5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the website is responsive across different devices by optimizing the layout and user interface for various screen sizes. Prioritize usability and readability on both desktop and mobile devices but i use desktop first approach.

## Additional Notes
- **Authentication**: if completed before the deadline.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on Github page and netlify.
- **Note**: The data used for properties rental and feedback is generated by AI and does not represent real-world data. This synthetic data is intended for demonstration purposes only and may not accurately reflect actual property listings or user feedback.
